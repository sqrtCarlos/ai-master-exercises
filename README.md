# AI Master Classes Exercises

Welcome to my repository where I store the solutions for my AI master classes exercises. This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover a wide range of topics in Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on Artificial Vision, Spatial Filters, and Noise Removal.

This repository is intended to serve as a reference point for those who are interested in understanding AI concepts and want to see them implemented in code. The notebooks are well-documented and contain explanations along with the code to make the learning process easier.
## Content

The repository is divided into the following sections:
1. Artificial Vision: This section contains exercises that focus on the techniques and algorithms used in computer vision.
2. Spatial Filters: Here, you will find exercises that deal with spatial filters, which are used for image processing tasks like smoothing, sharpening, and edge detection.
3. Noise Removal: This section is dedicated to exercises on noise removal techniques in image processing.

## Installation

To run these notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install it via Anaconda distribution. Follow the instructions on the official
[Jupyter installation guide](https://jupyter.org/install).
